	abstract = {Objective: This study participated in the 2017 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge dedicated to the classification of atrial fibrillation (AF), normal sinus rhythm (Normal), other arrhythmia (Other) and strong noise, using single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings with a duration 50 ms from the preceding RR interval; (2) Poincaré plot geometry estimated by the ratio of the minor-to-major semi-axes of the fitted ellipse; (3) P-wave presence in the average beat; (4) mean percentage of the RR interval first differences; and (5) mean correlation of all beats against the average beat. The global rank of feature extraction methods highlighted that HRV alone was able to provide 92.5\% of the maximal F1 score (0.74 versus 0.8). The added value of more complex ECG morphology analysis was less significant for Normal, AF, and Other rhythms (+0.02 to 0.08 points) than for Noise (+0.19 points); however, these were indispensable for wearable ECG recording devices with frequent artefact disturbance.},

	url = {https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cmmm/2019/4936179/},
	abstract = {Hypertension is a common and chronic disease and causes severe damage to patients’ health. Blood pressure of a human being is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. Heart rate variability (HRV) is an impact of the autonomic nervous system and an indicator of the balance of the cardiac sympathetic nerve and vagus nerve. HRV is a good method to recognize the severity of hypertension due to the specificity for prediction. In this paper, we proposed a novel fine-grained HRV analysis method to enhance the precision of recognition. In order to analyze the HRV of the patient, we segment the overnight electrocardiogram (ECG) into various scales. 18 HRV multidimensional features in the time, frequency, and nonlinear domain are extracted, and then the temporal pyramid pooling method is designed to reduce feature dimensions. Multifactor analysis of variance (MANOVA) is applied to filter the related features and establish the hypertension recognizing model with relevant features to efficiently recognize the patients’ severity. In this paper, 139 hypertension patients’ real clinical ECG data are applied, and the overall precision is 95.1\%. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed recognition method in the work.},

	abstract = {Kubios HRV is an advanced and easy to use software for heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. The software supports several input data formats for electrocardiogram (ECG) data and beat-to-beat RR interval data. It includes an adaptive QRS detection algorithm and tools for artifact correction, trend removal and analysis sample selection. The software computes all the commonly used time-domain and frequency-domain HRV parameters and several nonlinear parameters. There are several adjustable analysis settings through which the analysis methods can be optimized for different data. The ECG derived respiratory frequency is also computed, which is important for reliable interpretation of the analysis results. The analysis results can be saved as an ASCII text file (easy to import into MS Excel or SPSS), Matlab MAT-file, or as a PDF report. The software is easy to use through its compact graphical user interface. The software is available free of charge for Windows and Linux operating systems at http://kubios.uef.fi.},
