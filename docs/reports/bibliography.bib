	abstract = {Human computer interaction is increasingly utilized in smart home, industry 4.0 and personal health. Communication between human and computer can benefit by a flawless exchange of emotions. As emotions have substantial influence on cognitive processes of the human brain such as learning, memory, perception and problem solving, emotional interactions benefit different applications. It can further be relevant in modern health care especially in interaction with patients suffering from stress or depression. Additionally rehabilitation applications, guiding patients through their rehabilitation training while adapting to the patients emotional state, would be highly motivating and might lead to a faster recovery. Depending on the application area, different systems for emotion recognition suit different purposes. The aim of this work is to give an overview of methods to recognize emotions and to compare their applicability based on existing studies. This review paper should enable practitioners, researchers and engineers to find a system most suitable for certain applications. An entirely contact-less method is to analyze facial features with the help of a video camera. This is useful when computers, smart-phones or tablets with integrated cameras are included in the task. Smart wearables provide contact with the skin and physiological parameters such as electro-dermal activity and heart related signals can be recorded unobtrusively also during dynamical tasks. Next to unimodal solutions, multimodal affective computing systems are analyzed since they promise higher classification accuracy. Accuracy varies based on the amount of detected emotions, extracted features, classification method and the quality of the database. Electroencephalography achieves 88.86 \% accuracy for four emotions, multimodal measurements (Electrocardiography, Electromyography and bio-signals) 79.3 \% for four emotive states, facial recognition 89 \% for seven states and speech recognition 80.46 \% for happiness and sadness. Looking forward, heart-related parameters might be an option to measure emotions accurately and unobtrusive with the help of smart wearables. This can be used in dynamic or outdoor tasks. Facial recognition on the other hand is a useful contact-less tool when it comes to emotion recognition during computer interaction.},

Emotion schemas, the most frequently occurring emotion experiences, are dynamic emotion-cognition interactions that may consist of momentary/ situational responding or enduring traits of personality that emerge over developmental time. Emotions play a critical role in the evolution of consciousness and the operations of all mental processes. Types of emotion relate differentially to types or levels of consciousness. Unbridled imagination and the ability for sympathetic regulation of empathy may represent both potential gains and losses from the evolution and ontogeny of emotion processes and consciousness. Unresolved issues include psychology’s neglect of levels of consciousness that are distinct from access or reflective consciousness and use of the term “unconscious mind” as a dumpster for all mental processes that are considered unreportable. The relation of memes and the mirror neuron system to empathy, sympathy, and cultural influences on the development of socioemotional skills are unresolved issues destined to attract future research.},

Subjects in 10 cultures performed a more complex judgment task than has been used in previous cross-cultural studies. Instead of limiting the subjects to selecting only one emotion term for each expression, this task allowed them to indicate that multiple emotions were evident and the intensity of each emotion. Agreement was very high across cultures about which emotion was the most intense. The 10 cultures also agreed about the second most intense emotion signaled by an expression and about the relative intensity among expressions of the same emotion. However, cultural differences were found in judgments of the absolute level of emotional intensity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Being different from traditional multimodal emotion sensing systems, our proposed system recognizes human emotions with the single modularity of GSR signal, which is captured by wearable sensing devices. A comprehensive set of features is extracted from GSR signal and fed into supervised classifiers for emotion identification. Our system has been evaluated by specific experiments to investigate the characteristics of human emotions in practice. The high accuracy of emotion classification highlights the great potential of this system in improving humans' mental health in the future.},

	abstract = {The Concealed Information Test has been advocated as the preferred method for deception detection using the polygraph ("lie detector"). The Concealed Information Test is argued to be a standardised, highly accurate psychophysiological test founded on the orienting reflex. The validity of polygraph tests for the assessment of psychopathic individuals has, however, been questioned. Two dimensions are said to underlie psychopathy: emotional detachment and antisocial behaviour. Distinct psychophysiological correlates are hypothesised in these facets of psychopathy. Emotional detachment is associated with deficient fear-potentiated startle, and antisocial behaviour with reduced orienting. Few studies have examined the effect of psychopathy on the validity of the Concealed Information Test. This review suggests that reduced orienting in high antisocial individuals is also found in the Concealed Information Test, thereby threatening its validity. Implications for criminal investigations, possible solutions and directions for future research will be discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {As an essential way of human emotional behavior understanding, speech emotion recognition (SER) has attracted a great deal of attention in human-centered signal processing. Accuracy in SER heavily depends on finding good affect- related , discriminative features. In this paper, we propose to learn affect-salient features for SER using convolutional neural networks (CNN). The training of CNN involves two stages. In the first stage, unlabeled samples are used to learn local invariant features (LIF) using a variant of sparse auto-encoder (SAE) with reconstruction penalization. In the second step, LIF is used as the input to a feature extractor, salient discriminative feature analysis (SDFA), to learn affect-salient, discriminative features using a novel objective function that encourages feature saliency, orthogonality, and discrimination for SER. Our experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our approach leads to stable and robust recognition performance in complex scenes (e.g., with speaker and language variation, and environment distortion) and outperforms several well-established SER features.},
