# Emotion Recognition

Read the [report](docs/reports/Report.pdf)

Emotions play a critical role in the evolution of consciousness and the operations of all mental processes. The different types of emotions have been shown to be related to various levels of consciousness.
Positive emotions help improve human health and work efficiency, while negative emotions may cause health problems.

Experiences of negative emotions are inevitable and at times useful.
Even so, when extreme, prolonged, or contextually inappropriate, negative emotions can trigger a wide array of problems for individuals and for society.
Fear and anxiety, for instance, fuel phobias and other anxiety disorders and together with acute and chronic stress may compromise immune functioning and create susceptibilities to stress-related physical disorders.

For some individuals, sadness and grief may swell into unipolar depression, which when severe can lead to immunosuppression, loss of work productivity, and suicide.
Anger and its poor management have been implicated in the etiology of heart disease, and some cancers, as well as in aggression and violence, especially in boys and men.

Emotion recognition helps to qualitatively and quantitavely understand emotions, providing tools to aid the cure of a lot of mental diseases and disorders.

In general, emotion recognition methods can be classified into two major categories.
The first is using human physical signals such as facial expression, speech, gesture, posture, etc., which has the advantage of easy collection and has been studied for years.
However, their reliability cannot be guaranteed, as it’s relatively easy for people to control physical signals like facial expressions or speech to hide their real emotions especially during social communications.

The other category is using internal signals i.e. the physiological signals, which include the electroencephalogram(EEG), temperature(T), electrocardiogram(ECG), electromyogram(EMG), galvanic skin response(GSR), respiration(RSP).
Physiological signals are generated in response to the Central Nervous System (CNS) and the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) of human body, in which emotion changes, according to Cannon’s theory.
One of the major benefits of the latter method is that the CNS and the ANS are largely involuntarily activated and therefore cannot be easily controlled.
